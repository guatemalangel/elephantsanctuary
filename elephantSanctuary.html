                        <p class="mission">The Elephant Sanctuary exists to...
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            provide captive elephants with individualized care, the companionship of a herd, and the
                            opportunity
                            to live out their lives in a safe haven dedicated to their well-being
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            educate the public of the complex needs of elephants in captivity and the crisis facing
                            elephants in
                            the wild
                        </p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Our Work</h3>
                        <p id="work">Since 1995, The Sanctuary has provided refuge for 31 elephants who are retired from
                            zoos
                            and circuses. There are currently nine elephant residents with room for more. The Elephant
                            Sanctuary
                            in Tennessee began on 110 acres and has grown to three separate and protected, natural
                            habitats,
                            spanning over more than 3,060 acres. <br><br>

                            The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee provides elephants retired from entertainment and
                            exhibition
                            with herd, home, and individualized veterinary and husbandry care for life. Elephants that
                            have
                            lived their lives in captivity have an opportunity at The Sanctuary to live in an expansive
                            habitat
                            that allows for a range of natural behaviors. <br><br>

                            Many of the elephants suffer long-term health and complex behavioral issues common to
                            elephants that
                            have spent their lives in captivity, such as tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, obesity,
                            arthritis, and
                            aggression. Because elephants have complex physical and social needs, successful outcomes
                            are
                            measured not only by the elephant’s physical health, but also their social, behavioral and
                            psychological well-being. <br><br>

                            As a true sanctuary, The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee is closed to the public. The best
                            way to
                            see the elephants is by live-streaming EleCams, which can be viewed on this site. <br><br>

                            Education is a very important part of The Sanctuary's mission. Through Distance Learning,
                            The
                            Sanctuary teaches hundreds of school and community groups around the world a respect for
                            wildlife
                            while learning about the crisis facing Asian and African elephants in captivity and in the
                            wild.
                            <br><br>

                            In the wild, elephants are migratory, walking miles each day. They form intricate family
                            structures
                            and grieve for their dead in a more-than-instinctive way. They show humor and express
                            compassion.
                            The Elephant Sanctuary’s mission is to give elephants the freedom they deserve.<br><br>
